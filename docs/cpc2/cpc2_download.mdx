The challenge data is now published and [available for download on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17045970). On the Zenodo site you will find the following.

- The challenge training set data packaged as a single 12 GB file, **clarity_CPC2_data.v1_1.tgz**
- The evaluation set data packaged as a single 500 MB file, **clarity_CPC2_data.test.v1_0.tgz**. The evaluation data should be untarred into the same root as the training data.
- Evaluation set labels packaged as a small 46 KB file, **clarity_CPC2_data.labels.v1_0.tar.gz**. These were not made available to entrants during the challenge but have been released subsequently to allow self-evaluation.

The Github repository containing the baseline code is [here](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity/tree/main/recipes/cpc2). The repository contains code for all the Clarity enhancement and prediction challenges.  You will find all the necessary instructions for installing the data and setting up the baseline system: i.e. producing the better-ear HASPI predictions.
