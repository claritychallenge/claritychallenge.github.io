### Software

All the necessary software tools are available as part of the PyClarity software package available on [GitHub](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity). The challenge is using **version 0.5.x** of the package.

We recommend that you download and install the latest packaged release in the 0.5.x series [from GitHub](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity/releases). Doing this will make it easy to access the command-line recipes for the baseline system.

The software can be installed as a library using

```pip install "pyclarity~=0.5.1"```

Further installation instructions are available in the repository's [README](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity).

### Data

The data is available on MyAirBridge at [https://mab.to/BndoGwtUhjTL3](https://mab.to/BndoGwtUhjTL3).

If you have any issues with the download, please contact the challenge organisers.
