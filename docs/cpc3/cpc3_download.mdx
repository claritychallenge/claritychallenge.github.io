The challenge data is now published and [available for download on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17039000). On the Zenodo site you will find the following.

- The challenge training set data packaged as a single 7.5 GB file, **clarity_CPC3_data.v1_1.tar.gz**
- The development set data packaged as a single 752 MB file, **clarity_CPC3_data.dev.v1_0.tar.gz**.
- The evaluation set data packaged as a single 6.1 GB file, **clarity_CPC3_data.eval.v1_0.tar.gz**.
- Development and Evaluation set labels packaged as a small 515 KB file, **clarity_CPC3_data.labels.tar.gz**. The evaluation set labels were not made available to entrants during the challenge but have been released subsequently to allow self-evaluation.
- A small 20 MB demo dataset for preview purposes, **clarity_CPC3_demo_data.v1_0.tar.gz**.

All packages should be unpacked under the same root.

The Github repository containing the baseline code is [here](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity/tree/main/recipes/cpc3). The repository contains code for all the Clarity enhancement and prediction challenges.  You will find all the necessary instructions for installing the data and setting up the baseline system: i.e. producing the better-ear HASPI predictions.

:::info
The Challenge is now closed but the data is still available for anyone to use. If using the data please cite the Zenodo dataset:

Barker, J. (2025). 3rd Clarity Prediction Challenge (CPC3) dataset for hearing aid speech intelligibility prediction [Data set]. Zenodo. `<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17039000>`;

We are preparing a paper describing the dataset and summarising the challenge outcomes which will provide a more suitable reference. When this paper is available we will update the citation details.
