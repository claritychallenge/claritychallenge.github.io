## Hearing loss model

This is an open-source python implementation of a hearing loss model developed by Brian Moore, Michael Stone and other members of the Auditory Perception Group, University of Cambridge  \[[1](#refs), [2](#refs)\].

- **Inputs**: A stereo wav audio signal, e.g., the output of the hearing aid model and audiograms for left and right ear.
- **Outputs**: The signal after simulating the hearing loss as specified by the set of audiograms (stereo wav file), `<scene>_<listener>_HL-output.wav`

## Differentiable source separation and hearing aid amplification modules

The modules are from the [Sheffield E009 system](https://github.com/TuZehai/Sheffield_Clarity_CEC1_Entry) in CEC1. The source separation module is a multi-channel Conv-TasNet optimised with a SNR objective. The hearing aid amplification module is an FIR filter optimised with an objective, which is the combination of a differentiable approximation to the hearing loss model and a STOI loss.

- **Inputs**: six channels of mixed signals, i.e., `mixed_CH1.wav`, `mixed_CH2.wav`, and `mixed_CH3.wav`
- **Outputs**: a single channel enhanced signal, therefore two source separation and amplification modules for left and right ears need to be optimised for the enhanced binaural signal.

## Speech intelligibility model (MBSTOI)

Python implementation of a binaural intelligibility model, Modified Binaural Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (MBSTOI)  \[[3](#refs)\]. Note that MBSTOI requires signal time-alignment (and alignment within one-third octave bands).

- **Inputs**: HL-model output signals, audiogram, reference target signal (i.e., the premixed target signal convolved with the BRIR with the reflections 'turned off', specified as 'target_anechoic'), (scene metadata)
- **Outputs**: predicted intelligibility score
