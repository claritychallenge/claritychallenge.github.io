The challenge data is now published and [available for download on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17046604). On the Zenodo site you will find the following.

- The challenge training set data packaged as a single 14 GB file, **clarity_CPC1_data.v1_1.tgz**
- The evaluation set data packaged as a single 6.5 GB file, **clarity_CPC1_data.test.v1.tgz**. The evaluation data should be untarred into the same root as the training data.
- Evaluation set labels packaged as a small 130 KB file, **clarity_CPC1_data.labels.v1_0.tar.gz**. These were not made available to entrants during the challenge but have been released subsequently to allow self-evaluation.

The Github repository containing the baseline code is [here](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity/tree/main/recipes/cpc1). The repository contains code for all the Clarity enhancement and prediction challenges.  You will find all the necessary instructions for installing the data and setting up the baseline system: i.e. running the MSBG hearing loss model and MBSTOI intelligibility prediction stage. We will be making a further small release in early December to specify the final evaluation metrics that we will be using to rank entries.
