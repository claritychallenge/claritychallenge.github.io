----------------------------------------------

Dear colleague,

It gives us great pleasure to announce the launch of the 3rd Clarity Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CPC3).

**The Challenge**

To improve hearing enhancement technologies, such as hearing aids and hearable devices, we need reliable methods for automatically assessing the speech intelligibility of audio signals.

In recent years, we have organised the CPC1 and CPC2 Challenges to promote the development of such prediction systems.  We are now launching the third round of this challenge, building on previous efforts by incorporating a more extensive and diverse set of listener data for training and evaluation.

**What will be provided**

- **Hearing aid outputs**: Audio produced by various simulated hearing aids while processing speech in noisy environments.
- **Clean speech reference signals**
- **Listening Test Results**: This includes transcripts and intelligibility scores from tests in which hearing-impaired listeners were asked to repeat what they heard.
- **Listener Characteristics**: Information regarding the severity of hearing impairment for each listener.
- **Software Tools**: Tools include a baseline system based on HASPI scores.

{/*truncate*/}

Your system will need to predict intelligibility scores based on the hearing aid outputs. We will explore two types of systems: intrusive metrics, which also use clean speech reference signals, and non-intrusive systems that make predictions based solely on the hearing aid outputs.

There will be **cash prizes** for the top three systems courtesy of our sponsors, the Hearing Industry Research Consortium ([https://hearingirc.com/](https://hearingirc.com/))

For further details, including how to obtain the data and how to register to enter, please  see [https://claritychallenge.org/docs/cpc3/cpc3_intro](https://claritychallenge.org/docs/cpc3/cpc3_intro).

**The Workshop**

The results of the new challenge will be showcased at an ISCA workshop satellite event of Interspeech 2025 in Rotterdam on 22nd August 2025.
