It gives us great pleasure to pre-announce the 3rd Clarity Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CPC-3) that will launch in March 2025.

**The Challenge**

To develop better hearing enhancement technologies, including hearing aids and hearable devices, **we need reliable methods to automatically evaluate the speech intelligibility of audio signals**. This requires a predictive model that takes as input both the audio produced by a hearing aid and listener characteristics (e.g., their audiogram) and estimates the speech intelligibility score that the listener would achieve in a listening test.

In recent years, we have run the CPC1 Challenge and CPC2 Challenge to advance such models.  We are now launching the third round of this challenge, which builds on previous efforts by incorporating a larger and more diverse set of listener data for training and evaluation.

**What will be provided**

- Audio produced by a variety of (simulated) hearing aids for speech-in-noise;
- The corresponding clean reference signals (the original speech);
- Characteristics of the listeners (pure tone audiograms, etc);
- The measured speech intelligibility scores from listening tests, where hearing-impaired listeners were asked to say what they heard after listening to the hearing aid processed signals.
- Software tools including a baseline system based on HASPI scores.

**The Workshop**

The results of the new challenge will be showcased at an ISCA workshop, a satellite event to Interspeech 2025 in Rotterdam on 22nd August 2025 (TBC).
