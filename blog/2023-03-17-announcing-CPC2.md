The 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge - [Register Now](https://claritychallenge.org/docs/cpc2/taking_part/cpc2_registration)

To allow the development of better hearing aids, we need ways to evaluate the speech intelligibility of audio signals automatically. We need a prediction model that takes the audio produced by a hearing aid and the listener's characteristics (e.g. audiogram) and estimates the speech intelligibility score that the listener would achieve in a listening test.

Last year we ran the [CPC1 Challenge](https://claritychallenge.org/docs/cpc1/cpc1_intro) to develop such models. The challenge was presented at an online workshop and a special session of Interspeech 2022. We are now running the 2nd round of this challenge (CPC2), which builds on the first by using more complex signals and a larger set of listening test data for training and evaluating the prediction systems.

The outputs of the new challenge will be presented at an [ISCA workshop](https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2023-workshop/) that is being run as a satellite event to Interspeech 2023 in Dublin on 19th August 2023.

Full details can be found on the Challenge Website.

### Register now to take part

If you are interested in participating please register now via the [online registration form](https://claritychallenge.org/docs/cpc2/taking_part/cpc2_registration).

### Important Dates

- March - Launch of challenge, release of training data + baseline system.
- 1st July - Release of evaluation data and opening of submission window.
- 31st July - Submission deadline.
- 19th August - ISCA Clarity 2023 workshop @ Interspeech
- 19th September - Deadline for submission of finalised Workshop papers

### What will be provided

- Audio produced by a variety of (simulated) hearing aids for speech-in-noise;
- The corresponding clean reference signals (the original speech);
- Characteristics of the listeners (pure tone audiograms, etc);
- The measured speech intelligibility scores from listening tests, where hearing-impaired listeners were asked to say what they heard after listening to the hearing aid processed signals.
- Software tools including a baseline system based on HASPI scores.
