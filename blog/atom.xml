<p>The event will be a one-day workshop held as an ISCA satellite event to Interspeech 2023 in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
<p>For registration and programme details please visit the workshop website</p>
<p><a href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity2023-workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity2023-workshop/</a></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT DATES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2nd June 2023 - Workshop Submission Deadline (Regular Papers)</li>
<li>31st July 2023 - Workshop Submission Deadline (Clarity Challenge Papers)</li>
<li>5th August 2023 - Registration closes</li>
<li>19th August - Workshop / Clarity Challenge results announced</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for hearing-impaired listeners is understanding speech in the presence of background noise. Everyday social noise levels can have a devastating impact on speech intelligibility. The inability to communicate effectively can lead to social withdrawal and isolation. Disabling hearing impairment affects 360 million people worldwide, with that number increasing because of the ageing population. Unfortunately, current hearing aid technology is often ineffective in noisy situations. Although amplification can restore audibility, it does not compensate fully for the effects of hearing loss.</p>
<p>The Clarity workshops are designed to stimulate a two-way conversation between the speech research community and hearing aid developers. Hearing aid developers, who are not typically represented at Interspeech, will have an opportunity to present the challenges of their industry to the speech community; the speech community will be able to present and discuss potentially transformative approaches to speech in noise processing in the presence of hearing researchers and industry experts.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<p>Any work related to the challenges of hearing aid signal processing will be considered relevant topics include,</p>
<ul>
<li>Binaural technology for speech enhancement and source separation</li>
<li>Multi-microphone processing technology</li>
<li>Real-time approaches to speech enhancement</li>
<li>Statistical model-driven approaches to hearing aid processing</li>
<li>Audio quality &amp; intelligibility assessment hearing aid and cochlear implant users</li>
<li>Efficient and effective integration of psychoacoustic testing in machine learning</li>
<li>Machine learning for diverse target listeners</li>
<li>Machine learning models of hearing impairment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The Clarity-2023 will also host the 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge, that is addressing the problem of developing new intrusive and non-intrusive approaches to hearing-aid speech intelligibility prediction. The Challenge will be launching on 1st March, is you may be interested in participating please sign up to our Google group for further announcements.</p>

<p>To allow the development of better hearing aids, we need ways to evaluate the speech intelligibility of audio signals automatically. We need a prediction model that takes the audio produced by a hearing aid and the listener's characteristics (e.g. audiogram) and estimates the speech intelligibility score that the listener would achieve in a listening test.</p>
<p>Last year we ran the <a href="https://claritychallenge.org/docs/cpc1/cpc1_intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPC1 Challenge</a> to develop such models. The challenge was presented at an online workshop and a special session of Interspeech 2022. We are now running the 2nd round of this challenge (CPC2), which builds on the first by using more complex signals and a larger set of listening test data for training and evaluating the prediction systems.</p>
<p>The outputs of the new challenge will be presented at an <a href="https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2023-workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISCA workshop</a> that is being run as a satellite event to Interspeech 2023 in Dublin on 19th August 2023.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce the release of the <strong>2nd Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2)</strong> baseline system code.</p>
<p>The baseline code has been released in the latest commit to the <a href="https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarity GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>The baseline system perform NAL-R amplification according to the audiogram of the target listener, followed by a simple gain control and output of the signals to 16-bit stereo wav format. The system has been kept deliberately simple with no microphone array processing or attempt at noise cancellation.</p>
<p>HASPI scores for the dev set have been measured. The scores are as follows.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>System</th><th>HASPI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unprocessed</td><td>0.1615</td></tr><tr><td>NAL-R baseline</td><td>0.2493</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>See <a href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/docs/cec2/software/cec2_baseline">here</a> for further details.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="some-comments-on-signal-alignment-and-level-insensitivity">Some comments on signal alignment and level-insensitivity<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some comments on signal alignment and level-insensitivity" title="Direct link to Some comments on signal alignment and level-insensitivity" href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/blog/baseline#some-comments-on-signal-alignment-and-level-insensitivity">​</a></h3>
<p>Our baseline binaural speech intelligibility measure in round one is the Modified Binaural Short-Time Objective Intelligibility measure, or MBSTOI. This short post outlines the importance of correcting for delays that your hearing aid processing algorithm introduces into the audio signals to allow MBSTOI to estimate the speech intelligibility accurately. It also discusses the importance of considering the audibility of signals before evaluation with MBSTOI.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="evaluation">Evaluation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evaluation" title="Direct link to Evaluation" href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/blog/baseline#evaluation">​</a></h2>
<p>In stage one, entries will be ranked according to the average MBSTOI score across all samples in the evaluation test set. In the second stage, entries will be evaluated by the listening panel. There will be prizes for both stages. See this <a href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity_CEC1_doc/docs/cec1_rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="signal-alignment-in-time-and-frequency">Signal alignment in time and frequency<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signal alignment in time and frequency" title="Direct link to Signal alignment in time and frequency" href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/blog/baseline#signal-alignment-in-time-and-frequency">​</a></h2>
<p>If the signal processed by the hearing aid introduces a significant delay, you should correct for this delay before submitting your entry. This is necessary because MBSTOI requires alignment of the clean speech “reference” with the processed signal in time and frequency. This needs to be done for both ear signals.</p>
<p>MBSTOI downsamples signals to 10 kHz, uses a Discrete Fourier Transform to decompose the signal into one-third octave bands, and performs envelope extraction and short-time segmentation into 386 ms regions. Each region consists of 30 frames. These approaches are motivated by what is know about which frequencies and modulation frequencies are most important for intelligibility. For each frequency band and frame (over the region of which it is the last frame), an intermediate correlation coefficient is calculated between the clean reference and processed power envelopes for each ear. These are averaged to obtain the MBSTOI index. Thus is usually between 0 and 1, and rises monotonically with measured intelligibility scores, such that higher values indicate greater speech intelligibility. Alignment is therefore required at the level of the one-third octave bands and short-time regions.</p>
<p>Our baseline corrects for broadband delay per ear due to the hearing loss model. (The delay is measured by running a kronnecker delta function through the model for each ear.) However, the baseline software will not correct for delays created by your hearing aid processing.</p>
<p>Consequently, when submitting your hearing aid output signals, you are responsible for correcting for any delays introduced by your hearing aid. Note that this must be done blindly; the clean reference signals will not be supplied for the test/evaluation set.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="level-insensitivity">Level insensitivity<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Level insensitivity" title="Direct link to Level insensitivity" href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/blog/baseline#level-insensitivity">​</a></h2>
<p>MBSTOI is level-independent, i.e., MBSTOI is broadly insensitive to the level of the processed signal because it is calculated using a cross-correlation method. This could be a problem because sounds that are below the auditory thresholds of the hearing impaired listener may appear to MBSTOI to be highly intelligible.</p>
<p>To overcome this, the baseline experimental code mbstoi_beta, in conjunction with the baseline hearing loss model, can be used to approximate hearing-impaired auditory thresholds. Specifically, mbstoi_beta adds internal noise that can be used to approximate normal hearing auditory thresholds. This noise, in combination with the attenuation of signals by the hearing loss model to simulate raised auditory thresholds, makes MBSTOI level-sensitive.</p>
<p>The noise is created by filtering white noise using pure tone threshold filter coefficients with one-third octave weighting, approximating the shape of a typical auditory filter (from Moore 2012, based on Patterson’s method, 1976). This noise is added to the processed signal. Note, the standard MBSTOI in the equalisation-cancellation stage adds internal noise to parameters, but this is an independent process.</p>

<p>The method was developed by Asger Heidemann Andersen, Jan Mark de Haan, Zheng-Hua Tan and Jesper Jensen (Andersen et al., 2018). It builds on the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) metric created by Cees H. Taal, Richard C. Hendriks, Richard Heusdens, and Jesper Jensen (Taal et al., 2011). MBSTOI includes a better ear stage and an equalisation-cancellation stage. For simplicity, the latter stage is not discussed here; see Andersen et al. (2018) for details.</p>

<p>For a hearing aid to work well for users, the processing needs to be quick. The output of the hearing aid should be produced with a delay of less than about 10 ms. Many audio processing techniques are non-causal, i.e., the output of the system depends on samples from the future. Such processing is useless for hearing aids and therefore our rules include a restriction on the use of future samples.</p>
<p>The rules state the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems must be causal; the output at time t must not use any information from input samples more than 5 ms into the future (i.e., no information from input samples &gt;t+5ms).</li>
<li>There is no limit on computational cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure. Example of how the limit of 5 ms is applied to a hearing aid input and output signal.
We have a chosen a limit of 5 ms because in a real hearing aid there will be other sources of delay (e.g., analogue-to-digital, digital-to-analogue conversion).</p>

<p>Picking out speech from background noise is a critical problem even for the most sophisticated devices. The purpose of the Clarity Challenges is to catalyse new work to radically improve the speech intelligibility provided by hearing aids.</p>
<p>The series of challenges will consider increasingly complex listening scenarios. The first round, launching in January 2021, will focus on speech in indoor environments in the presence of a single interferer. It will begin with a challenge involving improving hearing aid processing. Future challenges on how to model speech-in-noise perception will be launched at a later date.</p>

<p>You will be provided with simulated scenes, each including a target speaker and interfering noise. For each scene, there will be signals that simulate those captured by a behind-the-ear hearing aid with three channels at each ear and those captured at the eardrum without a hearing aid present.  The target speech will be a short sentence and the interfering noise will be either speech or domestic appliance noise.</p>
<p>The task will be to deliver a hearing aid signal processing algorithm that can improve the intelligibility of the target speaker for a specified hearing-impaired listener. Initially, entries will be evaluated using an objective speech intelligibility measure we will provide. Subsequently, up to twenty of the most promising systems will be evaluated by a panel of listeners.</p>
<p>We will provide a baseline system so that teams can choose to focus on individual components or to develop their own complete pipelines.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Improving hearing aid processing using DNNs blog. A suggested approach to overcome the non-differentiable loss function.</p>
<p>The aim of our Enhancement Challenge is to get people producing new algorithms for processing speech signals through hearing aids. We expect most entries to replace the classic hearing aid processing of Dynamic Range Compressors (DRCs) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep neural networks (DNN)</a> (although all approaches are welcome!). The first round of the challenge is going to be all about improving speech intelligibility.</p>
<p>Setting up a DNN structure and training regime for the task is not as straightforward as it might first appear. Figure 1 shows an example of a naive training regime. An audio example of Speech in Noise (SPIN) is randomly created (<em>audio sample generation</em>, bottom left), and a listener is randomly selected with particular hearing loss characteristics (<em>random artificial listener generation</em>, top left). The DNN Enhancement model (represented by the bright yellow box) then produces improved speech in noise. (Audio signals in pink are two-channel, left and right because this is for binaural hearing aids.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="schematic" src="https://claritychallenge.github.io/assets/images/clarity_schematic_for_blog-09-602e0853d7a6c77eacab682e49402529.png" width="1149" height="446" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Next the improved speech in noise is passed to the Prediction Model in the lime green box, and this gives an estimation of the Speech Intelligibility (SI). Our baseline system will include algorithms for this. We’ve already blogged about the Hearing Loss Simulation. Our current thinking is that the intelligibility model will be using a binaural form of the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility Index (STOI) [1]. The dashed line going back to the enhancement model shows that the DNN will be updated based on the reciprocal of the Speech Intelligibility (SI) score. By minimising (1/SI), the enhancement model will be maximising intelligibility.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>The difficulty here is that updating the Enhancement Model DNN during training requires the error to be known at the DNN’s output (the point labelled “improved SPIN”). But we don’t know this, we only know the error on the output of the prediction model at the far right of the diagram. This wouldn’t be a problem if the prediction model could be inverted, because we could then run the 1/SI error backwards through the inverse model.</p>
<p>As the inverse of the prediction model isn’t available, one solution is to train another DNN to mimic its behaviour (Figure 2). As this new Prediction Model is a DNN, the 1/SI error can be passed backwards through it using standard neural network training formulations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="schematic" src="https://claritychallenge.github.io/assets/images/clarity_schematic_for_blog-10-9842f1551e82cd2aca1ab814230df345.png" width="873" height="432" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This DNN prediction model could be trained first using knowledge distillation (<a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/56234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is something I’ve previous done for a speech intelligibility model</a>), and then the weights frozen while the Enhancement Model is trained. But there is a ‘chicken and egg’ problem here. The difficulty is generating all the training data for the prediction model. Until you train the enhancement model, you won’t have a representative examples of “improved SPIN” to train the prediction model. But without the prediction model, you can’t train the enhancement model.</p>
<p>One solution is to train the two DNNs in tandem, with an approach analogous to how pairs of networks are trained in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generative Adversarial Network</a> (GAN). iMetricGan developed by Li et al. [2] is an example of this being done for speech enhancement, although the authors weren’t trying to include hearing loss simulation. They aren’t the only ones looking at trying to solve problems where a non-differentiable or black-box evaluation function is in the way of DNN training [3][4].</p>
<p>We hope our entrants will come up with lots of other ways of overcoming this problem. How would you tackle it?</p>

<p>In a previous blog, we set out the problem of using hearing aids to pick out speech in noisy places. When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</a> is low, hearing aids can only do so much to improve the intelligibility of the speech.</p>
<p>A solitary hearing aid has various ways of addressing everyday constant noises such as cars, vacuum cleaners and fans. The aids work best when the noise is not too intrusive and SNR is relatively high. Problems arise when the noise is high (low SNRs), because then the hearing aid processing can distort the sound too much. While the hearing aid might have limited success in improving intelligibility in certain cases, they can still make the noise less annoying (e.g., Brons et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Using multiple microphones on each hearing aid can help in noisy conditions. The sound from the microphones is combined in a way that boosts the speech relative to the noise. This technology can be put into larger hearing aids, when there is enough spacing between the front and rear microphones.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why our brains are really good at picking out speech from the hubbub of a restaurant, is that it compares and contrasts the sounds from both ears. Our hearing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binaural</a>. Similarly, if you have a hearing aids in both ears, they work better if they collaborate on reducing the noise.</p>
<p>Crucial to how our brains locate sound and pick out speech in noise are timing and level cues that come from comparing the sound at both ears. When sound comes from the side:</p>
<ul>
<li>interaural time differences occur because the sound arrives at one ear earlier than the other.</li>
<li>interaural level differences occur because the sound has to bend around the head to reach the furthest ear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Binaural hearing aids communicate wirelessly and use noise reduction strategies that preserve these interaural time and level difference cues (e.g., Van den Bogaert et al., 2009). This allows the listener’s brain to better locate the speech and boost this compared to the noise.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> methods can do for hearing aids. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn directly from example data. One machine learning method is the neural network. This is an algorithm formed from layers of simple computational units connected to each other in a way that is inspired by connections between neurons in the brain. Deep (3+ layer) neural networks are able to learn complex, non-linear mapping functions, which makes them ideal candidates for noise reduction tasks.</p>
<p>We anticipate that machine learning can help tackle the challenge of speech in noise for hearing aids, providing a tailored solution for each individual and listening situation. For example, one thing machine learning could do is to sense the acoustic environment the listener is in, and choose the most suitable processing settings.</p>

<p>In recent years, a machine learning approach for noise reduction has become popular. Neural networks are used to estimate time-frequency masks (a set of gains for each time-frequency unit that, when multiplied by the signal, produce less noisy speech; see, e.g., Zhao et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Machine learning systems for noise reduction are trained on artificially mixed speech and noise. Some operate on a single channel, i.e., using spectral cues, and some work with multiple channels using spatial cues. We expect that future hearing aids built on machine learning will perform best if they combine the left and right microphones to work binaurally.</p>
<p>Most of these noise reduction systems have been designed and evaluated in an off-line mode where they process pre-recorded signals. This isn’t much use for hearing aids that need to work in real-time with low latency (i.e., short delays). One challenge for hearing aids is to redesign off-line approaches to work quickly enough without too much loss of performance.</p>
<p>The potential for machine learning to produce better approaches to hearing aid processing is what motivated the Clarity Project. If you’re interested in hearing more as the challenges develop, please sign up.</p>
