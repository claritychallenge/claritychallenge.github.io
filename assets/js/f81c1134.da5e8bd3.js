Everyday social noise levels can have a devastating impact on speech intelligibility. The inability to communicate effectively can lead to social withdrawal and isolation. Disabling hearing impairment affects 360 million people worldwide, with that number increasing because of the ageing population. Unfortunately, current hearing aid technology is often ineffective in noisy situations. Although amplification can restore audibility, it does not compensate fully for the effects of hearing loss.\\n\\nThe Clarity workshops are designed to stimulate a two-way conversation between the speech research community and hearing aid developers. Hearing aid developers, who are not typically represented at Interspeech, will have an opportunity to present the challenges of their industry to the speech community; the speech community will be able to present and discuss potentially transformative approaches to speech in noise processing in the presence of hearing researchers and industry experts.\\n\\n**Topics**\\n\\nAny work related to the challenges of hearing aid signal processing will be considered relevant topics include,\\n\\n- Binaural technology for speech enhancement and source separation\\n- Multi-microphone processing technology\\n- Real-time approaches to speech enhancement\\n- Statistical model-driven approaches to hearing aid processing\\n- Audio quality & intelligibility assessment hearing aid and cochlear implant users\\n- Efficient and effective integration of psychoacoustic testing in machine learning\\n- Machine learning for diverse target listeners\\n- Machine learning models of hearing impairment\\n\\n**The 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge**\\n\\nThe Clarity-2023 will also host the 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge, that is addressing the problem of developing new intrusive and non-intrusive approaches to hearing-aid speech intelligibility prediction. The Challenge will be launching on 1st March, is you may be interested in participating please sign up to our Google group for further announcements.\\n\\n**Keynote Talks**\\n\\n- Prof Fei Chen, SUSTech, China,\\n- Prof DeLiang Wang, Ohio State University, US\\n\\n**Organisers**\\n\\n- Michael Akeroyd, University of Nottingham\\n- Jon Barker,  University of Sheffield\\n- Trevor Cox, University of Salford\\n- Fei Chen, Southern University of Science and Technology, China\\n- John Culling,  University of Cardiff\\n- Simone Graetzer, University of Salford\\n- Andrew Hines, University College Dublin\\n\\n**For further information**\\n\\nTo be kept up to date please join our [Clarity Challenge Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/clarity-challenge).

This short post outlines the importance of correcting for delays that your hearing aid processing algorithm introduces into the audio signals to allow MBSTOI to estimate the speech intelligibility accurately. It also discusses the importance of considering the audibility of signals before evaluation with MBSTOI.\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\nIn stage one, entries will be ranked according to the average MBSTOI score across all samples in the evaluation test set. In the second stage, entries will be evaluated by the listening panel. There will be prizes for both stages. See this [page](https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity_CEC1_doc/docs/cec1_rules) for more information.\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n## Signal alignment in time and frequency\\n\\nIf the signal processed by the hearing aid introduces a significant delay, you should correct for this delay before submitting your entry. This is necessary because MBSTOI requires alignment of the clean speech \u201creference\u201d with the processed signal in time and frequency. This needs to be done for both ear signals.\\n\\nMBSTOI downsamples signals to 10 kHz, uses a Discrete Fourier Transform to decompose the signal into one-third octave bands, and performs envelope extraction and short-time segmentation into 386 ms regions. Each region consists of 30 frames. These approaches are motivated by what is know about which frequencies and modulation frequencies are most important for intelligibility. For each frequency band and frame (over the region of which it is the last frame), an intermediate correlation coefficient is calculated between the clean reference and processed power envelopes for each ear. These are averaged to obtain the MBSTOI index. Thus is usually between 0 and 1, and rises monotonically with measured intelligibility scores, such that higher values indicate greater speech intelligibility. Alignment is therefore required at the level of the one-third octave bands and short-time regions.\\n\\nOur baseline corrects for broadband delay per ear due to the hearing loss model. (The delay is measured by running a kronnecker delta function through the model for each ear.) However, the baseline software will not correct for delays created by your hearing aid processing.\\n\\nConsequently, when submitting your hearing aid output signals, you are responsible for correcting for any delays introduced by your hearing aid. Note that this must be done blindly; the clean reference signals will not be supplied for the test/evaluation set.\\n\\n## Level insensitivity\\n\\nMBSTOI is level-independent, i.e., MBSTOI is broadly insensitive to the level of the processed signal because it is calculated using a cross-correlation method. This could be a problem because sounds that are below the auditory thresholds of the hearing impaired listener may appear to MBSTOI to be highly intelligible.\\n\\nTo overcome this, the baseline experimental code mbstoi_beta, in conjunction with the baseline hearing loss model, can be used to approximate hearing-impaired auditory thresholds. Specifically, mbstoi_beta adds internal noise that can be used to approximate normal hearing auditory thresholds. This noise, in combination with the attenuation of signals by the hearing loss model to simulate raised auditory thresholds, makes MBSTOI level-sensitive.\\n\\nThe noise is created by filtering white noise using pure tone threshold filter coefficients with one-third octave weighting, approximating the shape of a typical auditory filter (from Moore 2012, based on Patterson\u2019s method, 1976). This noise is added to the processed signal. Note, the standard MBSTOI in the equalisation-cancellation stage adds internal noise to parameters, but this is an independent process.\\n\\n## MBSTOI\\n\\nThe method was developed by Asger Heidemann Andersen, Jan Mark de Haan, Zheng-Hua Tan and Jesper Jensen (Andersen et al., 2018). It builds on the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) metric created by Cees H. Taal, Richard C. Hendriks, Richard Heusdens, and Jesper Jensen (Taal et al., 2011). MBSTOI includes a better ear stage and an equalisation-cancellation stage. For simplicity, the latter stage is not discussed here; see Andersen et al. (2018) for details.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- Andersen, A. H., de Haan, J. M., Tan, Z. H., & Jensen, J. (2018).

A suggested approach to overcome the non-differentiable loss function.\\n\\nThe aim of our Enhancement Challenge is to get people producing new algorithms for processing speech signals through hearing aids. We expect most entries to replace the classic hearing aid processing of Dynamic Range Compressors (DRCs) with [deep neural networks (DNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) (although all approaches are welcome!). The first round of the challenge is going to be all about improving speech intelligibility.\\n\\nSetting up a DNN structure and training regime for the task is not as straightforward as it might first appear. Figure 1 shows an example of a naive training regime. An audio example of Speech in Noise (SPIN) is randomly created (*audio sample generation*, bottom left), and a listener is randomly selected with particular hearing loss characteristics (*random artificial listener generation*, top left). The DNN Enhancement model (represented by the bright yellow box) then produces improved speech in noise. (Audio signals in pink are two-channel, left and right because this is for binaural hearing aids.)\\n\\n![schematic](/img/clarity_schematic_for_blog-09.png)\\n\\nFigure 1\\n\\nNext the improved speech in noise is passed to the Prediction Model in the lime green box, and this gives an estimation of the Speech Intelligibility (SI). Our baseline system will include algorithms for this. We\u2019ve already blogged about the Hearing Loss Simulation. Our current thinking is that the intelligibility model will be using a binaural form of the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility Index (STOI) [1]. The dashed line going back to the enhancement model shows that the DNN will be updated based on the reciprocal of the Speech Intelligibility (SI) score. By minimising (1/SI), the enhancement model will be maximising intelligibility.\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\nThe difficulty here is that updating the Enhancement Model DNN during training requires the error to be known at the DNN\u2019s output (the point labelled \u201cimproved SPIN\u201d). But we don\u2019t know this, we only know the error on the output of the prediction model at the far right of the diagram. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the prediction model could be inverted, because we could then run the 1/SI error backwards through the inverse model.\\n\\nAs the inverse of the prediction model isn\u2019t available, one solution is to train another DNN to mimic its behaviour (Figure 2). As this new Prediction Model is a DNN, the 1/SI error can be passed backwards through it using standard neural network training formulations.\\n\\n![schematic](/img/clarity_schematic_for_blog-10.png)\\n\\nThis DNN prediction model could be trained first using knowledge distillation ([this is something I\u2019ve previous done for a speech intelligibility model](http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/56234/)), and then the weights frozen while the Enhancement Model is trained. But there is a \u2018chicken and egg\u2019 problem here. The difficulty is generating all the training data for the prediction model. Until you train the enhancement model, you won\u2019t have a representative examples of \u201cimproved SPIN\u201d to train the prediction model. But without the prediction model, you can\u2019t train the enhancement model.\\n\\nOne solution is to train the two DNNs in tandem, with an approach analogous to how pairs of networks are trained in a [Generative Adversarial Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) (GAN). iMetricGan developed by Li et al. [2] is an example of this being done for speech enhancement, although the authors weren\u2019t trying to include hearing loss simulation. They aren\u2019t the only ones looking at trying to solve problems where a non-differentiable or black-box evaluation function is in the way of DNN training [3][4].\\n\\nWe hope our entrants will come up with lots of other ways of overcoming this problem. How would you tackle it?\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [1] Andersen, A.H., Haan, J.M.D., Tan, Z.H. and Jensen, J., 2015.

We\u2019ll also discuss what machine learning techniques are often used for noise reduction, and some promising strategies for hearing aids.\\n\\n![Tablet user](/img/UoN_HS-08207-1536x1024.jpeg)\\n\\nIn a previous blog, we set out the problem of using hearing aids to pick out speech in noisy places. When the [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) is low, hearing aids can only do so much to improve the intelligibility of the speech.\\n\\nA solitary hearing aid has various ways of addressing everyday constant noises such as cars, vacuum cleaners and fans. The aids work best when the noise is not too intrusive and SNR is relatively high. Problems arise when the noise is high (low SNRs), because then the hearing aid processing can distort the sound too much. While the hearing aid might have limited success in improving intelligibility in certain cases, they can still make the noise less annoying (e.g., Brons et al., 2014).\\n\\nUsing multiple microphones on each hearing aid can help in noisy conditions. The sound from the microphones is combined in a way that boosts the speech relative to the noise. This technology can be put into larger hearing aids, when there is enough spacing between the front and rear microphones.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why our brains are really good at picking out speech from the hubbub of a restaurant, is that it compares and contrasts the sounds from both ears. Our hearing is [binaural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural). Similarly, if you have a hearing aids in both ears, they work better if they collaborate on reducing the noise.\\n\\nCrucial to how our brains locate sound and pick out speech in noise are timing and level cues that come from comparing the sound at both ears. When sound comes from the side:\\n\\n- interaural time differences occur because the sound arrives at one ear earlier than the other.\\n- interaural level differences occur because the sound has to bend around the head to reach the furthest ear.\\n\\nBinaural hearing aids communicate wirelessly and use noise reduction strategies that preserve these interaural time and level difference cues (e.g., Van den Bogaert et al., 2009). This allows the listener\u2019s brain to better locate the speech and boost this compared to the noise.\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n## Machine learning\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in what [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) methods can do for hearing aids. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn directly from example data. One machine learning method is the neural network. This is an algorithm formed from layers of simple computational units connected to each other in a way that is inspired by connections between neurons in the brain. Deep (3+ layer) neural networks are able to learn complex, non-linear mapping functions, which makes them ideal candidates for noise reduction tasks.\\n\\nWe anticipate that machine learning can help tackle the challenge of speech in noise for hearing aids, providing a tailored solution for each individual and listening situation. For example, one thing machine learning could do is to sense the acoustic environment the listener is in, and choose the most suitable processing settings.\\n\\n![Electronic brain](/img/neural_brain.jpeg)\\n\\nImage via [www.vpnsrus.com](https://www.vpnsrus.com)\\n\\nIn recent years, a machine learning approach for noise reduction has become popular. Neural networks are used to estimate time-frequency masks (a set of gains for each time-frequency unit that, when multiplied by the signal, produce less noisy speech; see, e.g., Zhao et al., 2018).\\n\\nMachine learning systems for noise reduction are trained on artificially mixed speech and noise. Some operate on a single channel, i.e., using spectral cues, and some work with multiple channels using spatial cues. We expect that future hearing aids built on machine learning will perform best if they combine the left and right microphones to work binaurally.\\n\\nMost of these noise reduction systems have been designed and evaluated in an off-line mode where they process pre-recorded signals. This isn\u2019t much use for hearing aids that need to work in real-time with low latency (i.e., short delays). One challenge for hearing aids is to redesign off-line approaches to work quickly enough without too much loss of performance.\\n\\nThe potential for machine learning to produce better approaches to hearing aid processing is what motivated the Clarity Project.

For a machine learning algorithm to learn new ways of processing audio for the hearing impaired, it needs to estimate how the sound will be degraded by any hearing loss. Hence, we need an algorithm to simulate hearing loss for each of our listeners. The diagram belows shows our draft baseline system that was detailed in a previous blog. The hearing loss simulation is part of the prediction model. The Enhancement Model to the left is effectively the hearing aid and the Prediction Model to the right is estimating how someone will perceive the intelligibility of the speech in noise.\\n\\n![baseline](/img/baseline-1536x684.png)\\n\\nThe draft baseline system (where SPIN is speech in noise, DRC is Dynamic Range Compression, HL is Hearing Loss, SI is Speech Intelligibility and L & R are Left and Right).\\n\\nThere are different causes of hearing loss, but we\u2019re concentrating on the most common type that happens when you age ([presbycusis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hearing-loss/)). [RNID](https://rnid.org.uk/) (formerly Action on Hearing Loss) estimate that more than 40% of people over the age of 50 have a hearing loss, and this rises to 70% of people who are older than 70.\\n\\nThe aspects of hearing loss we\u2019ve decided to simulate are\\n\\n1. The loss of ability to sense the quietest sounds (increase in absolute threshold).\\n2. How as an audible sound increases in level, the perceived increase in loudness is greater than normal (loudness recruitment) (Moore et al. 1996).\\n3. How the ear has a poorer ability to discriminate the frequency of sounds (impaired frequency selectivity).\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n## Audio examples of hearing loss\\n\\nHere are two samples of speech in noise processed through the simulator.

Our brains then need to separate out what we want to hear (the target speaker) from the other sounds. This is especially difficult when the competing sounds are speech. This has the quaint name, The Cocktail Party Problem (Cherry, 1953). We don\u2019t go to many cocktail parties, but we encounter lots of times where the The Cocktail Party Problem is important. Hearing a conversation in a busy restaurant, trying to understand a loved one while the television is on or hearing the radio in the kitchen when the kettle is boiling, are just a few examples.\\n\\nDifficulty in picking out speech in noise is really common if you have a hearing loss. Indeed, it\u2019s often when people have problems doing this that they realise they have a hearing loss.\\n\\n```\\n\u201cHearing aids don\u2019t work when there is a lot of background noise. This is when you need them to work.\u201d\\n\\n-- Statement from a hearing aid wearer (Kochkin, 2000)\\n```\\n\\nHearing aids are the the most common form of treatment for hearing loss. However, surveys indicate that at least 40% of hearing aids are never or rarely used (Knudsen et al., 2010). A major reason for this is dissatisfaction with performance. Even the best hearing aids perform poorly for speech in noise. This is particularly the case when there are many people talking at the same time, and when the amount of noise is relatively high (i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low). As hearing ability worsen with age, the ability to understand speech in background noise also reduces (e.g., Akeroyd, 2008).\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\nWhen an audiologist assesses hearing loss, one thing they measure is the pure tone audiogram. This assesses the quietest sound someone can hear over a range of frequencies. However, an audiogram only partly explains your experience with speech in background noise (Heinrich et al. 2015), because it only measures the quietest sound you can hear. For example, picking out speech from noise is a complex task for the brain to perform, and this cognitive ability isn\u2019t assessed by an audiogram. In addition, there are other factors that are important such as personality, motivation, attitude toward hearing aids and prior hearing aid experience.\\n\\n![Audiogram](/img/audiogram.jpg)\\n\\nAn audiogram displaying a \u201cski slope\u201d pattern that is a sign of age-related hearing loss (source: Ronan and Barrett, BMJ, 2014).\\nSpeech-in-noise tests get closer to the real-life problem a hearing aid is trying to solve. Listeners listen to speech in the presence of noise and write down what words they hear. More words correct show an increase in the ability to understand speech in specific noisy situations when listeners are wearing their hearing aid (aided) relative to when they are not (unaided). Of course, listening conditions in the clinic differ from real-life conditions.\\n\\nCurrently, while speech-in-noise test scores can be useful when fine-tuning a hearing aid, even then many users are disappointed about the performance of their hearing aids. Through our challenges, we hope to improve this situation, whether you go to cocktail parties or not.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s your experience with speech in noise?

We\u2019re still working on the rules stipulating what is and what is not allowed (for example, will entrants be allowed to use data from outside the challenge).\\n\\nClarity\u2019s first enhancement challenge is focussed on maximising the speech intelligibility (SI) score. We will evaluate this first through a prediciton model that is based on a hearing loss simulation and an objective metric for speech intellibility. Simulation has been hugely important for generating training data in the [CHIME challenges](https://chimechallenge.github.io/chime6/) and so we intend to use that approach in Clarity. But results from simulated test sets cannot be trusted and hence a second evaluation will come through perceptual tests on hearing impaired subjects. However, one of our current problems is that we can\u2019t bring listeners into our labs because of COVID-19.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll actually be running two challenges in roughly parallel, because we\u2019re also going to task the community to improve our prediction model for speech intelligibility.\\n\\nWe\u2019re running a series of challenges over five years.
