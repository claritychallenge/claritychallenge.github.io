We believe this is in part because the training data and evaluation data were fully simulated and produced with the same simulation tools. Evaluating in this way may favour systems that are able to exploit the consistency of the simulation, but which do not generalise well to real-world scenarios. In the Clarity ICASSP 2023 challenge [1], it was seen that systems struggled with a real room evaluation set, even those that did well on the simulated evaluation set. So, in this first task, we are taking a step towards understanding the generalisation problem by constructing an evaluate set using impulse responses that have been recorded in a real room, and which therefore cannot be so easily modelled by simulation."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)("figure",{id:"fig1",children:[(0,a.jsxs)(r.Ay,{container:!0,spacing:1,children:[(0,a.jsx)(r.Ay,{item:!0,xs:12,sm:6,md:4,children:(0,a.jsx)("img",{height:"320",src:(0,o.Ay)("/img/CEC3/salford_speaker_eigenmike.jpg")})},1),(0,a.jsx)(r.Ay,{item:!0,xs:12,sm:6,md:4,children:(0,a.jsx)("img",{height:"320",src:(0,o.Ay)("/img/CEC3/eigenmike_portrait.jpg")})},2),(0,a.jsx)(r.Ay,{item:!0,xs:12,sm:6,md:4,children:(0,a.jsx)("img",{height:"320",src:(0,o.Ay)("/img/CEC3/salford_eigenmike_speaker.jpg")})},2)]}),(0,a.jsx)("figcaption",{children:"Figure 1. 6th Order Ambisonic Impulse responses recorded with an MH Acoustics' em64 Eigenmike "})]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"task-description",children:"Task Description"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The scenario is of a hearing aid user listening to a target speaker in a domestic living room while two or three interfering sounds are also active.
