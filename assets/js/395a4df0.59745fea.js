However, surveys indicate that at least 40% of hearing aids are never or rarely used (Knudsen et al., 2010). A major reason for this is dissatisfaction with performance. Even the best hearing aids perform poorly for speech in noise. This is particularly the case when there are many people talking at the same time, and when the amount of noise is relatively high (i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low). As hearing ability worsen with age, the ability to understand speech in background noise also reduces (e.g., Akeroyd, 2008)."})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},70763:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/cocktail_party-71794223ff171bbb15b0ac66be4b4414.jpeg"}}]);
