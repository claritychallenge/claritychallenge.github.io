However, surveys indicate that at least 40% of hearing aids are never or rarely used (Knudsen et al., 2010). A major reason for this is dissatisfaction with performance. Even the best hearing aids perform poorly for speech in noise. This is particularly the case when there are many people talking at the same time, and when the amount of noise is relatively high (i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low). As hearing ability worsen with age, the ability to understand speech in background noise also reduces (e.g., Akeroyd, 2008)."}),"\n","\n",(0,r.jsx)(i.p,{children:"When an audiologist assesses hearing loss, one thing they measure is the pure tone audiogram. This assesses the quietest sound someone can hear over a range of frequencies.

For example, picking out speech from noise is a complex task for the brain to perform, and this cognitive ability isn\u2019t assessed by an audiogram.

Listeners listen to speech in the presence of noise and write down what words they hear.
