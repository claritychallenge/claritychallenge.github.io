Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyse the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.\"\n        }, undefined, false, {\n          fileName: \"/Users/jon/shared/web/claritychallenge.github.io/docs/cpc2/cpc2_faq.mdx\",\n          lineNumber: 48,\n          columnNumber: 5\n        }, this)\n      }, undefined, false, {\n        fileName: \"/Users/jon/shared/web/claritychallenge.github.io/docs/cpc2/cpc2_faq.mdx\",\n        lineNumber: 47,\n        columnNumber: 3\n      }, this)]\n    }, undefined, true, {\n      fileName: \"/Users/jon/shared/web/claritychallenge.github.io/docs/cpc2/cpc2_faq.mdx\",\n      lineNumber: 45,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), \"\\n\", (0,react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.jsxDEV)(_components.h2, {\n      id: \"hearing-loss\",\n      children: \"Hearing Loss\"\n    }, undefined, false, {\n      fileName: \"/Users/jon/shared/web/claritychallenge.github.io/docs/cpc2/cpc2_faq.mdx\",\n      lineNumber: 52,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), \"\\n\", (0,react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.jsxDEV)(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"There are many types of hearing loss, but the focus of the Clarity project is the hearing loss that happens with ageing.

Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech-in-noise (SPIN) is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed.
