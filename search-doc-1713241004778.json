For each scene, there will be signals that simulate those captured by a behind-the-ear hearing aid with three channels at each ear and those captured at the eardrum without a hearing aid present. The target speech will be a short sentence and the interfering noise will be either speech or domestic appliance noise.  The task will be to deliver a hearing aid signal processing algorithm that can improve the intelligibility of the target speaker for a specified hearing-impaired listener. Initially, entries will be evaluated using an objective speech intelligibility measure we will provide. Subsequently, up to twenty of the most promising systems will be evaluated by a panel of listeners.  We will provide a baseline system so that teams can choose to focus on individual components or to develop their own complete pipelines.

This short post outlines the importance of correcting for delays that your hearing aid processing algorithm introduces into the audio signals to allow MBSTOI to estimate the speech intelligibility accurately. It also discusses the importance of considering the audibility of signals before evaluation with MBSTOI.

This is necessary because MBSTOI requires alignment of the clean speech “reference” with the processed signal in time and frequency. This needs to be done for both ear signals.  MBSTOI downsamples signals to 10 kHz, uses a Discrete Fourier Transform to decompose the signal into one-third octave bands, and performs envelope extraction and short-time segmentation into 386 ms regions. Each region consists of 30 frames. These approaches are motivated by what is know about which frequencies and modulation frequencies are most important for intelligibility. For each frequency band and frame (over the region of which it is the last frame), an intermediate correlation coefficient is calculated between the clean reference and processed power envelopes for each ear. These are averaged to obtain the MBSTOI index. Thus is usually between 0 and 1, and rises monotonically with measured intelligibility scores, such that higher values indicate greater speech intelligibility. Alignment is therefore required at the level of the one-third octave bands and short-time regions.  Our baseline corrects for broadband delay per ear due to the hearing loss model. (The delay is measured by running a kronnecker delta function through the model for each ear.) However, the baseline software will not correct for delays created by your hearing aid processing.  Consequently, when submitting your hearing aid output signals, you are responsible for correcting for any delays introduced by your hearing aid. Note that this must be done blindly; the clean reference signals will not be supplied for the test/evaluation set.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Level insensitivity​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Baseline speech intelligibility model in round one","url":"/blog/baseline#level-insensitivity","content":" MBSTOI is level-independent, i.e., MBSTOI is broadly insensitive to the level of the processed signal because it is calculated using a cross-correlation method. This could be a problem because sounds that are below the auditory thresholds of the hearing impaired listener may appear to MBSTOI to be highly intelligible.  To overcome this, the baseline experimental code mbstoi_beta, in conjunction with the baseline hearing loss model, can be used to approximate hearing-impaired auditory thresholds. Specifically, mbstoi_beta adds internal noise that can be used to approximate normal hearing auditory thresholds. This noise, in combination with the attenuation of signals by the hearing loss model to simulate raised auditory thresholds, makes MBSTOI level-sensitive.  The noise is created by filtering white noise using pure tone threshold filter coefficients with one-third octave weighting, approximating the shape of a typical auditory filter (from Moore 2012, based on Patterson’s method, 1976). This noise is added to the processed signal. Note, the standard MBSTOI in the equalisation-cancellation stage adds internal noise to parameters, but this is an independent process.

The event will be a one-day workshop held as an ISCA satellite event to Interspeech 2023 in Dublin, Ireland. For registration and programme details please visit the workshop website https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity2023-workshop/ IMPORTANT DATES 2nd June 2023 - Workshop Submission Deadline (Regular Papers)31st July 2023 - Workshop Submission Deadline (Clarity Challenge Papers)5th August 2023 - Registration closes19th August - Workshop / Clarity Challenge results announced About One of the biggest challenges for hearing-impaired listeners is understanding speech in the presence of background noise. Everyday social noise levels can have a devastating impact on speech intelligibility. The inability to communicate effectively can lead to social withdrawal and isolation. Disabling hearing impairment affects 360 million people worldwide, with that number increasing because of the ageing population. Unfortunately, current hearing aid technology is often ineffective in noisy situations. Although amplification can restore audibility, it does not compensate fully for the effects of hearing loss. The Clarity workshops are designed to stimulate a two-way conversation between the speech research community and hearing aid developers. Hearing aid developers, who are not typically represented at Interspeech, will have an opportunity to present the challenges of their industry to the speech community; the speech community will be able to present and discuss potentially transformative approaches to speech in noise processing in the presence of hearing researchers and industry experts. Topics Any work related to the challenges of hearing aid signal processing will be considered relevant topics include, Binaural technology for speech enhancement and source separationMulti-microphone processing technologyReal-time approaches to speech enhancementStatistical model-driven approaches to hearing aid processingAudio quality &amp; intelligibility assessment hearing aid and cochlear implant usersEfficient and effective integration of psychoacoustic testing in machine learningMachine learning for diverse target listenersMachine learning models of hearing impairment The 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge The Clarity-2023 will also host the 2nd Clarity Prediction Challenge, that is addressing the problem of developing new intrusive and non-intrusive approaches to hearing-aid speech intelligibility prediction.

The output of the hearing aid should be produced with a delay of less than about 10 ms. Many audio processing techniques are non-causal, i.e., the output of the system depends on samples from the future. Such processing is useless for hearing aids and therefore our rules include a restriction on the use of future samples.  The rules state the following:  Systems must be causal; the output at time t must not use any information from input samples more than 5 ms into the future (i.e., no information from input samples &gt;t+5ms).There is no limit on computational cost.    Mathematically this is:  yn=f(xm , xm+1 ... xn+N-1 , xn+N , L )  where yn is the output from your hearing aid for sample nnn.xxx is the audio input signal from a hearing aid microphone.N=0.005fsN = 0.005 fsN=0.005fs where fsfsfs is the sampling frequency.mmm is a sample number where m≤nm \\le nm≤n.LLL is the listener characteristics.f()f()f() is the hearing aid function.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn directly from example data. One machine learning method is the neural network. This is an algorithm formed from layers of simple computational units connected to each other in a way that is inspired by connections between neurons in the brain. Deep (3+ layer) neural networks are able to learn complex, non-linear mapping functions, which makes them ideal candidates for noise reduction tasks.  We anticipate that machine learning can help tackle the challenge of speech in noise for hearing aids, providing a tailored solution for each individual and listening situation. For example, one thing machine learning could do is to sense the acoustic environment the listener is in, and choose the most suitable processing settings.    Image via www.vpnsrus.com  In recent years, a machine learning approach for noise reduction has become popular. Neural networks are used to estimate time-frequency masks (a set of gains for each time-frequency unit that, when multiplied by the signal, produce less noisy speech; see, e.g., Zhao et al., 2018).  Machine learning systems for noise reduction are trained on artificially mixed speech and noise. Some operate on a single channel, i.e., using spectral cues, and some work with multiple channels using spatial cues. We expect that future hearing aids built on machine learning will perform best if they combine the left and right microphones to work binaurally.  Most of these noise reduction systems have been designed and evaluated in an off-line mode where they process pre-recorded signals. This isn’t much use for hearing aids that need to work in real-time with low latency (i.e., short delays). One challenge for hearing aids is to redesign off-line approaches to work quickly enough without too much loss of performance.  The potential for machine learning to produce better approaches to hearing aid processing is what motivated the Clarity Project.

Clarity project’s first enhancement challenge will be about hearing speech from a single talker in a typical living room, where there is one source of noise and a little reverberation.  We’re currently working on developing simulation tools to allow us to generate our living room data. The room acoustic will be simulated using RAVEN and the Hearing Device Head-related Transfer Functions will come from Denk’s work. We’re working on getting better, more ecologically valid speech than is often used in speech intelligibility work.    Entrants are then given training data and development (dev) test data along with a baseline system that represents the current state-of-the-art. You can find a post and video on the current thinking on the baseline here. We’re still working on the rules stipulating what is and what is not allowed (for example, will entrants be allowed to use data from outside the challenge).  Clarity’s first enhancement challenge is focussed on maximising the speech intelligibility (SI) score. We will evaluate this first through a prediciton model that is based on a hearing loss simulation and an objective metric for speech intellibility. Simulation has been hugely important for generating training data in the CHIME challenges and so we intend to use that approach in Clarity. But results from simulated test sets cannot be trusted and hence a second evaluation will come through perceptual tests on hearing impaired subjects. However, one of our current problems is that we can’t bring listeners into our labs because of COVID-19.  We’ll actually be running two challenges in roughly parallel, because we’re also going to task the community to improve our prediction model for speech intelligibility.  We’re running a series of challenges over five years. What other scenarios should we consider? What speech? What noise? What environment? Please comment below.

Intelligibility will be evaluated as the number of words identified correctly in the sentence.  Our plan is that each listener will evaluate 1,200 sentences, which is about 4 hours of listening, and that every listener will evaluate sentences from every entrant. We will use a combinatorial design to equate this as far as possible.

We will allow participants to set the volume so that the sounds are not so loud to be uncomfortable. Without loudness-recruitment measures for our listeners, we cannot be sure just what loudnesses every participant will hear, so we need to allow them to make the choice here.  We have measurements on the output capability of a system in the laboratory:  A 1 kHz pure tone set to be the most powerful it can be (i.e., an amplitude range of +/-1 = RMS amplitude of 0.707, and the volume controls at 100%) gave 99 dB(A) SPL on the PC-8 headphones.An ICRA speech-shaped noise [1], unmodulated in time, and scaled to an RMS of 0.3, gave 90 dB(A) at the same volume level. With this RMS, the noise had 0.1% of its samples clipped at +/- 1.  It is important to note that there is a convention for the prediction model that a +/-1 square wave has RMS = 0 dB FS and corresponds to 120 dB, while for listening tests, 0 dB FS corresponds to approximately 100 dB, given the above capabilities of the reproduction equipment.  For the listening tests, we will require the signals to be provided as 16-bit WAV files with a 32 kHz sampling rate (see this page). We will play the signals as is using a HTML/PHP audio player coded on a webpage. The responsibility for the final signal level is therefore yours.

It can refer to how much speech is understood by a listener, or to the number of words correctly identified by a listener as a proportion or percentage of the total number of words. In the Clarity project, we are using the latter definition, i.e., the percentage of words in a sentence that a listener identified correctly. This percentage is the target for your prediction models.  Speech intelligibility captures how a listener's ability to participate in conversation is changed when the speech signal is degraded, e.g., by background noise and room reverberation, or is processed, e.g., by a hearing aid. Your prediction model will need to incorporate a model of the hearing abilities of each listener.

In this project, speech intelligibility is measured as the number of words identified correctly as a percentage of the total number of words in a sentence.  You might consider looking at other metrics, such as Word Error Rate (WER), which picks up on, e.g., where listeners insert words not in the original sentence. You might do this if you think that an estimate of WER or other metrics would help your system to estimate speech intelligibility, as defined in the Clarity project.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"How is Speech Intelligibility objectively measured by a computer?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"CEC2 FAQ","url":"/docs/cec2/taking_part/cec2_faq#how-is-speech-intelligibility-objectively-measured-by-a-computer","content":" When fitting a hearing aid, it would be beneficial for an audiologist to be able to use an objective measure of speech intelligibility to determine what signal processing algorithm(s) should be used to compensate for the listener's hearing impairment. Objective measures are also useful when measured speech intelligibility scores are unavailable, such as when developing a machine learning-based hearing aid algorithm or some other speech enhancement method. Another advantage of non-intrusive measures is that they do not require time-alignment of processed and reference signals.  Objective measures - or metrics - of speech intelligibility are used to allow a computer to estimate the likely performance of humans in listening tests. The main goal of entries to the prediction challenge is to produce one of these measures that performs well for listeners with hearing loss. There are two broad classes of speech intelligibility models:  Intrusive metrics (also known as double-ended) are most common. This is where the intelligibility is estimated by comparing the degraded or processed speech signal with the original clean speech signal.Non-intrusive metrics (also known as single-ended or blind) are less well developed. This is where intelligibility is estimated from the degraded or processed speech signal alone.  In the Clarity project, both types of metrics are of interest. Intrusive metrics will be more accurate in many cases. However, there are hearing aid processes where the speech content is shifted in frequency, which will defeat most current intrusive speech intelligibility metrics. We also hypothesise that there might be issues with intrusive metrics and machine learning approaches in hearing aids that revoice the original speech.

In this seminar from the first Clarity workshop, James Kates discusses speech intelligibility models with a focus on the ones he has developed. He also discusses the speech quality metric HASQI. If you're interested in using HASPI or HASQI for the challenge, James Kates has kindly made the MATLAB code and user guide available for download.    Click arrow to see synopsis. Signal degradations, such as additive noise and nonlinear distortion, can reduce the intelligibility and quality of a speech signal. Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyse the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.

Click arrow to see synopsis. Hearing loss leads to several unwanted effects. Loss of audibility for soft sounds is one effect, but also when amplification is used to create audibility for soft sounds, many suprathreshold deficits remain. The most common type of hearing loss is a cochlear hearing loss, where haircells or nerve synapses in the cochlea are damaged. Ageing and noise exposure are the most common causes of cochlear hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is associated with atypical loudness perception and difficulties in noisy situations. Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech-in-noise (SPIN) is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed. The balance between being able to have a conversation with a specific communication partner in a group of people and being able to switch attention if someone else starts to talk will be touched upon.

The experiment will be run by our “Listen@Home” web software running on either the participant’s own computer or a tablet we supply. The software plays each sentence once, then the participant speaks aloud what they think was said by the target talker. Their response is recorded by the headset’s microphone for offline scoring. We ask that the participant uses a quiet room for the experiment.  Intelligibility will be evaluated as the number of words identified correctly in the sentence.  Our plan is that each listener will undertake a few hours of listening and evaluate sentences from every entrant. We will use a combinatorial design to equate this as far as possible.  Should a listener drop out from the panel, we will endeavour to replace them with someone with a similar hearing loss, but should that prove impractical we will reduce the size of the panel, and inform entrants which listener has withdrawn.

We will allow participants to set the volume so that the sounds are not so loud to be uncomfortable. Without loudness-recruitment measures for our listeners, we cannot be sure just what loudnesses every participant will hear, so we need to allow them to make the choice here.  We have measurements of the output capability of a system in the laboratory:  A 1 kHz pure tone set to be the most powerful it can be (i.e., an amplitude range of +/-1 = RMS amplitude of 0.707, and the volume controls at 100%) gave 99 dB(A) SPL on the PC-8 headphones.An ICRA speech-shaped noise [1], unmodulated in time, and scaled to an RMS of 0.3, gave 90 dB(A) at the same volume level. With this RMS, the noise had 0.1% of its samples clipped at +/- 1.  Due to the above capabilities of the reproduction equipment, in the submitted signals, 0 dB FS should correspond to 100 dB SPL. We will also require the signals to be provided as 16-bit WAV files with a 32 kHz sampling rate.  We will play the signals as is using an HTML/PHP audio player coded on a webpage. The responsibility for the final signal level is therefore yours. It’s worth bearing in mind that should your signals overall seem too loud to be comfortable to a participant, they may well turn down the volume themselves.

It can refer to how much speech is understood by a listener, or to the number of words correctly identified by a listener as a proportion or percentage of the total number of words. In the Clarity project, we are using the latter definition, i.e., the percentage of words in a sentence that a listener identified correctly. This percentage is the target for your prediction models.  Speech intelligibility captures how a listener's ability to participate in conversation is changed when the speech signal is degraded, e.g., by background noise and room reverberation, or is processed, e.g., by a hearing aid. Your prediction model will need to incorporate a model of the hearing abilities of each listener.

In this project, speech intelligibility is measured as the number of words identified correctly as a percentage of the total number of words in a sentence.  You might consider looking at other metrics, such as Word Error Rate (WER), which picks up on, e.g., where listeners insert words not in the original sentence. You might do this if you think that an estimate of WER or other metrics would help your system to estimate speech intelligibility, as defined in the Clarity project.

Objective measures are also useful when measured speech intelligibility scores are unavailable, such as when developing a machine learning-based hearing aid algorithm or some other speech enhancement method. Another advantage of non-intrusive measures is that they do not require time-alignment of processed and reference signals.  Objective measures - or metrics - of speech intelligibility are used to allow a computer to estimate the likely performance of humans in listening tests. The main goal of entries to the prediction challenge is to produce one of these measures that performs well for listeners with hearing loss. There are two broad classes of speech intelligibility models:  Intrusive metrics (also known as double-ended) are most common. This is where the intelligibility is estimated by comparing the degraded or processed speech signal with the original clean speech signal.Non-intrusive metrics (also known as single-ended or blind) are less well developed. This is where intelligibility is estimated from the degraded or processed speech signal alone.  In the Clarity project, both types of metrics are of interest. Intrusive metrics will be more accurate in many cases. However, there are hearing aid processes where the speech content is shifted in frequency, which will defeat most current intrusive speech intelligibility metrics. We also hypothesise that there might be issues with intrusive metrics and machine learning approaches in hearing aids that revoice the original speech.

In this seminar from the first Clarity workshop, James Kates discusses speech intelligibility models with a focus on the ones he has developed. He also discusses the speech quality metric HASQI. If you're interested in using HASPI or HASQI for the challenge, James Kates has kindly made the MATLAB code and user guide available for download.    Click arrow to see synopsis. Signal degradations, such as additive noise and nonlinear distortion, can reduce the intelligibility and quality of a speech signal. Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyse the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.

Click arrow to see synopsis. Hearing loss leads to several unwanted effects. Loss of audibility for soft sounds is one effect, but also when amplification is used to create audibility for soft sounds, many suprathreshold deficits remain. The most common type of hearing loss is a cochlear hearing loss, where haircells or nerve synapses in the cochlea are damaged. Ageing and noise exposure are the most common causes of cochlear hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is associated with atypical loudness perception and difficulties in noisy situations. Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech-in-noise (SPIN) is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed. The balance between being able to have a conversation with a specific communication partner in a group of people and being able to switch attention if someone else starts to talk will be touched upon.

The person is listening to a target talker, who is selected from our set of 40 speakers. The target talker is producing one of our unique 7-10 word Clarity utterances. Simultaneously, an interferer sound is playing; this is either a competing talker or a continuous noise source (e.g., a washing machine). The target and interferer are at the same height as the listener. The room dimensions, boundary materials, and the locations of the listener, target and interferer are randomised (discussed below). An example scenario is shown in Figure 1. The room geometry showing origin location is defined in Figure 2.  Example SceneRoom Geometry Figure 1. Example overview.  Figure 3, below, shows the basic scene generator. The sound at the receiver is generated first by convolving the source signals with Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs). The reverberated speech and noise signals are then summed after appropriate gains are applied. The gains are set to achieve a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which is chosen pseudo-randomly between limits. The BRIRs are generated using the RAVEN Geometric Room Acoustic Model [1].  There are additional signal paths and outputs generated that have been omitted from Figure 3 for clarity. In addition to the reverberated signals associated with the hearing aid microphones, the signal close to the eardrum is also generated. You can also access the reverberated speech and noise signals before they are mixed.    Figure 3. Simplified diagram of the scene generator.

Note that the interferer can be at any azimuth from the point of view of the listener/receiver.  A desired signal-to-noise ratio, SNRD_DD​ (dB), is chosen using a uniform probability distribution random number generator between the limits of ranges specified for the speech and non-speech interferers. The better ear SNR, here termed BE_SNR, which models the better ear effect in binaural listening, is calculated for the reference channel (channel 1, which corresponds to the front microphone of the hearing aid).

The same types of data are available for training, development and evaluation.  A panel of hearing-aided listeners will be recruited for evaluation. They will be experienced bilateral hearing-aid users: they use two hearing aids but the hearing loss may be asymmetrical. The average pure tone air-conduction hearing loss will be between 25 and about 60 dB in the better ear. They will be fluent in British English.  The quantification of the listeners’ hearing is done with:  Left and right pure tone air-conduction audiograms. These measure the threshold at which people can hear a pure-tone sound.Results from the DTT (digit-triplet test, also known as a triple digit test)​  The audiogram is the standard clinical measurement of hearing ability. It’s the pure-tone threshold of hearing in each ear, measured in quiet in a sound booth. The procedure is standardized e.g., British Society of Audiology Recommended Procedure. Typically it’s measured at octave frequencies and important intermediate frequencies.The values of the audiogram defines how much gain the hearing aid needs to apply, with the calculation typically done by one of a group of &quot;prescription rules&quot;, e.g. CAMFIT, NAL-NL2 or DSL .  Note that the scale of an audiogram is in “dB HL” = “dB Hearing Level”. This is not dB SPL; instead, it’s relative to an international standard such that 0-dB is “normal hearing” at every frequency. For background see Why the Audiogram Is Upside-down | The Hearing Review and The Quest for Audiometric Zero | The Hearing Review  The DTT is an adaptive test of speech-in-noise ability. In each trial a listener hears three spoken digits (e.g. 3-6-1) against a background of noise at a given signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The task is to respond on a keypad with those three digits in the order they were presented. If the listener gets all three correct, then the SNR is reduced for the next trial so making it slightly harder. If the listener makes any mistake (i.e., any digit wrong, or the order wrong) then the SNR is increased, so making the next trial slightly easier. The test carries on trial-by-trial. The test asymptotes to the SNR at which the participant is equally likely to get all three correct or not, with a few tens of trials needed to get an acceptable result. DTT tests are now used world-wide to measure hearing as they are easy to make in any local language, to explain to participants and to do, and moreover can be done over the internet or telephone as they measure a relative threshold (signal-to-noise ratio), not an absolute threshold in dB SPL. Listeners are encouraged to set a volume that is comfortable and that does not distort or crackle, but is not too quiet.  This paper is a recent scoping review of the field. The particular version we used is Vlaming et al.'s high-frequency DTT, which uses a high-pass noise as the masker. Ours starts at -14 dB SNR, goes up/down at 2 dB steps per trial, and continues for 40 trials.  In the datafile, an average of the SNR for the last 30 trials is provided (labelled 'threshold'). For reference, the SNRs are supplied for each trial as well. The very first trial is practice and is not scored.

This captures aspects of the problem that were previously neglected including complex head motions, real room acoustics, and real microphone characteristics.

Participants will be provided with signals recorded over left and right hearing aid shells each with three microphones. These devices were worn by a participant who was seated in front of loudspeakers that were reproducing scenes similar to those used in previous Clarity challenges. Loudspeakers were moved between recording sessions in order to produce a large set of spatial configurations.  Figure 2. A domestic scenario for Task 2: one talker, a listener who rotates their head, and at least two sources of unwanted sound.  The task design has been modelled closely on CEC2, with a 6,000 scene training set recorded in the same way as the development and evaluation sets. Participants are asked to training systems using this data. They may also augment the training data using the simulation tools and simulated data from previous challenge rounds, or using any publicly available resources. We are also providing ground truth head motion data that can be used to improve system performance. We are interested in how well systems can exploit this information.  Evaluation sets will contain data that are closely matched to the training sets that will be used for ranking systems. However, we will also publish some additional ‘surprise’ evaluation sets that are deliberately mismatched in a number of ways (listener head size, room T60 time, source location distribution). These will be used to study how well systems generalise outside of the training domain. Evaluation will initially be performed using the HASPI objective metric, but this will be followed by a round of subjective listening tests with hearing-impaired listeners.  In the sections that follow we provide a detailed description of the challenge data; the rules that all systems need to follow; the evaluation metric and the performance of a baseline system.

This enhancement is individualised for each listener; hence, there is also a system to select a random listener (white ellipse) with a particular set of characteristics (e.g., audiograms). The SPIN that has been improved by the hearing aid is then passed to the prediction stage (orange box). This comprises two models: a hearing loss model, anda binaural speech intelligibility model.

The target and interferer signals were played using a set of 13 loudspeakers arranged around a listener. The listener was wearing hearing aid shells with three microphones (front, middle, back) and a pair of glasses with reflective markers that were tracked with a Vicon motion capture system. Nine loudspeakers were placed in front of the listener arranged at semi-randomly selected locations on a polar grid (the grid has distances of 2 m to 4 m spaced at 0.5 m and angles from -60 degrees to 60 degrees spaced at 7.5 degrees). The remaining four loudspeakers were placed in a line behind the listener. For each scene, one of the front loudspeakers was chosen to play the target utterances, and two or three of the 12 remaining speakers (front and back) were chosen to play the interferers.  Recording Room...another view... and another. Figure 1a. A view of the recording room with a B&amp;K HATS in the listener position. (The four rear loudspeakers are not visible in this in this view.)  Scenes were recording in blocks of 125 where each block had the same target speaker and the same speaker locations. The front speakers were labelled 1 to 9 so that they could be easily identified by the listener. For each scene one of the 9 front speakers, other than the target speaker, was chosen as the initial look direction speaker. Before the scene is played, the look-direction speaker plays it's number and the listener is instructed to turn to face it. Then after a short pause the multisource scene plays. Within the scene, the target speaker starts about two seconds after the interfering noise sources. The listener is asked to attend to the target speech source and turn to face it when it starts, and also to note down the speaker number. This process is repeated 125 times with a short pause between scenes. The entire block recording lasts about 20 minutes and once recording is complete the audio and headtracking data is segmented into individual scenes.  After each recording block the front speakers are moved to a new set of locations on the grid. Each of the 80 blocks has its own unique speaker layout. The speaker locations were randomised such there was only ever one loudspeaker along each radial direction and that the loudspeaker were spread across the full range of angles. Some examples are shown below. The precise locations of the speakers are provided in the metadata for each scene.  Figure 2. Six of the 80 different speaker layouts that were used.  Following CEC2, the scenes were designed to produce a large range of SNRs for the target. This was set to be between -12 dB and 6 dB in the condition that all the loudspeaker signals are instantaneously added. Note, the actual SNRs recorded at the microphones will vary further depending on the rooms acoustics and the listeners head rotation etc, e.g., SNRs will be higher than that recording in the meta data if the target is closer to the listener than the interferers, and lower if the target is further away. (We plan to release estimates of the SNRs at the microphones in the future.)  The signals were recorded using hearing aid shell with three microphones (front, middle and back). The figure below shows how these are positions when the shell are being worn. The microphones are each about 1 cm apart and form an approximately horizontal line when the head it level.

This was the sampling rate at which all the audio target and interferer materials are stored and so was used for scene construction. However, signals were then upsampled to 48 kHz to meet the specification of the recording and playback hardware in the recording room. So take care to convert the sample numbers to the correct rate if you are using them to analyse the audio, e.g. to endpoint the target speech.The SNR is not the SNR at the microphones. It is the SNR that would be obtained if the signals delivered to the loudspeakers were summed instantaneously (i.e. without any room acoustic effects). They can be used as a rough guide. We plan to produce estimates of the true SNRs later in the challenge to allow for more accurate performance evaluation. The SNR is computed over the duration of the target signal and using a speech weighted filter. The signal generation code will be made available in the GitHub repository.

These responses can then be used in place of the 6th order ambisonic impulse responses that were generated using room simulation in the previous challenge.  Recordings were made for 32 random configurations of a listener, a target and up to three interferers. Configurations were randomised in advanced and marked out on the floor of the recording room. For each configuration, the microphone is placed at the position of the listener and a loudspeaker is placed, in turn, at each of the sound source positions and directed towards the microphone. The sine-sweep method is then used to estimate the impulse response. The process is repeat for all 32 configurations and for target and three interferers, i.e. 32 x (3 + 1) = 128 impulse responses are recorded in total.  The room is an acoustically treated recording room with approximate dimensions of 5m x 5m x 2m. Some images are provided below for context.  The recording room...another view... and another.

The room configurations were randomly generated by independently selecting the x and y coordinates of the listener, target and interferers. The positions were chosen uniformly at random within the dimensions of the room, excluding a 1m border around the walls. It was also imposed that no sound source should be within 1 m of the listener, i.e., samples were rejected and redrawn if this was the case. As with CEC2, for each configuration a height (z) was randomly chosen to be either 1.2m (simulating sitting) or 1.6m (simulating standing) and the microphone and loudspeakers were placed at this height.

It can refer to how much speech is understood by a listener, or to the number of words correctly identified by a listener as a proportion or percentage of the total number of words. In the Clarity project, we are using the latter definition, i.e., the percentage of words in a sentence that a listener identified correctly. This percentage is the target for your prediction models.  Speech intelligibility captures how a listener's ability to participate in conversation is changed when the speech signal is degraded, e.g., by background noise and room reverberation, or is processed, e.g., by a hearing aid. Your prediction model will need to incorporate a model of the hearing abilities of each listener.

In this project, speech intelligibility is measured as the number of words identified correctly as a percentage of the total number of words in a sentence.  You might consider looking at other metrics, such as Word Error Rate (WER), which picks up on, e.g., where listeners insert words not in the original sentence. You might do this if you think that an estimate of WER or other metrics would help your system to estimate speech intelligibility, as defined in the Clarity project.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"How is Speech Intelligibility objectively measured by a computer?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/cpc1/taking_part/cpc1_faq#how-is-speech-intelligibility-objectively-measured-by-a-computer","content":" When fitting a hearing aid, it would be beneficial for an audiologist to be able to use an objective measure of speech intelligibility to determine what signal processing algorithm(s) should be used to compensate for the listener's hearing impairment. Objective measures are also useful when measured speech intelligibility scores are unavailable, such as when developing a machine learning-based hearing aid algorithm or some other speech enhancement method. Another advantage of non-intrusive measures is that they do not require time-alignment of processed and reference signals.  Objective measures - or metrics - of speech intelligibility are used to allow a computer to estimate the likely performance of humans in listening tests. The main goal of entries to the prediction challenge is to produce one of these measures that performs well for listeners with hearing loss. There are two broad classes of speech intelligibility models:  Intrusive metrics (also known as double-ended) are most common. This is where the intelligibility is estimated by comparing the degraded or processed speech signal with the original clean speech signal.Non-intrusive metrics (also known as single-ended or blind) are less well developed. This is where intelligibility is estimated from the degraded or processed speech signal alone.  In the Clarity project, both types of metrics are of interest. Intrusive metrics will be more accurate in many cases.

In this seminar from the first Clarity workshop, James Kates discusses speech intelligibility models with a focus on the ones he has developed. He also discusses the speech quality metric HASQI. If you're interested in using HASPI or HASQI for the challenge, James Kates has kindly made the MATLAB code and user guide available for download.    Click arrow to see synopsis. Signal degradations, such as additive noise and nonlinear distortion, can reduce the intelligibility and quality of a speech signal. Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyse the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.

Click arrow to see synopsis. Hearing loss leads to several unwanted effects. Loss of audibility for soft sounds is one effect, but also when amplification is used to create audibility for soft sounds, many suprathreshold deficits remain. The most common type of hearing loss is a cochlear hearing loss, where haircells or nerve synapses in the cochlea are damaged. Ageing and noise exposure are the most common causes of cochlear hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is associated with atypical loudness perception and difficulties in noisy situations. Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech-in-noise (SPIN) is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed. The balance between being able to have a conversation with a specific communication partner in a group of people and being able to switch attention if someone else starts to talk will be touched upon.

But for other characterisations of hearing, only some of the panel have provided data. Therefore there is missing data that has to be dealt with.  One approach to the missing data is to just ignore it and just use the audiograms. The problem with this approach is that audiograms only quantifies the hearing threshold, and our speech in noise audio samples were not played that quietly. Nevertheless, audiograms are the most common way of characterising hearing loss. Alternatively, a method to use the partial data could be developed, and we expect this would help with speech intelligibility prediction. You will find plenty of data science blog posts, e.g. towards data science discussing different approaches.  A key question is whether the missing data is 'missing at random' i.e. is the distribution of the missing data expected to be the same as that of the present data? For the prediction challenge, this would mean the missing triple-digit-test values are coming from some random sample of the listeners, who'd be no different from the listeners who did complete the triple-digital-test. Unfortunately, this might not be true, because the failure to complete the triple-digit-tests could well correlate with hearing loss (e.g. maybe older people with more hearing loss were less likely to do the test). The Clarity data is probably 'missing not at random'.  One simple solution is to delete examples with missing data, but the loss of so much data probably makes this undesirable.  A more sophisticated approach is to fill gaps in data via imputation i.e. first estimate values for the missing data and then treat the dataset as complete. A couple of simple approaches for imputation are: (i) use the mean value from the dataset for missing values, and (ii) create a model to estimate the missing data from the audiograms. There are other approaches in data science that could be exploited such as coding the missing values into a 'N/A' category within the input data.

In the Clarity project, we are using the latter definition, i.e., the percentage of words in a sentence that a listener identified correctly. This percentage is the target for your prediction models.  Speech intelligibility captures how a listener's ability to participate in conversation is changed when the speech signal is degraded, e.g., by background noise and room reverberation, or is processed, e.g., by a hearing aid. Your prediction model will need to incorporate a model of the hearing abilities of each listener.

Objective measures are also useful when measured speech intelligibility scores are unavailable, such as when developing a machine learning-based hearing aid algorithm or some other speech enhancement method. Another advantage of non-intrusive measures is that they do not require time-alignment of processed and reference signals.  Objective measures - or metrics - of speech intelligibility are used to allow a computer to estimate the likely performance of humans in listening tests. The main goal of entries to the prediction challenge is to produce one of these measures that performs well for listeners with hearing loss. There are two broad classes of speech intelligibility models:  Intrusive metrics (also known as double-ended) are most common. This is where the intelligibility is estimated by comparing the degraded or processed speech signal with the original clean speech signal.Non-intrusive metrics (also known as single-ended or blind) are less well developed. This is where intelligibility is estimated from the degraded or processed speech signal alone.  In the Clarity project, both types of metrics are of interest. Intrusive metrics will be more accurate in many cases. However, there are hearing aid processes where the speech content is shifted in frequency, which will defeat most current intrusive speech intelligibility metrics. We also hypothesise that there might be issues with intrusive metrics and machine learning approaches in hearing aids that revoice the original speech.

They are listening to a target talker, who is selected from our set of 40 speakers. The target talker is producing one of our unique 7-10 word Clarity sentences. Simultaneously, an interferer sound is playing. This is either a competing talker or a continuous noise source (e.g., a washing machine). The target and interferer are at the same height as the listener. The room dimensions, boundary materials, and the locations of the listener, target and interferer are randomised (discussed below). An example of the scenario is shown in Figure 1. The room geometry showing origin location is defined in Figure 2.  Example SceneRoom Geometry Figure 1. Example scene.  Figure 3, below, shows the basic scene generator. The sound at the receiver is generated first by convolving the source signals with Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs). This generates reverberated speech and noise that includes the effects of the room and reflections from the listener's head. The reverberated speech and noise signals are then summed after appropriate gains are applied. The gains are set to achieve a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which is chosen randomly between limits. The BRIRs are generated using the RAVEN Geometric Room Acoustic Model [1].  There are additional signal paths and outputs generated that have been omitted from Figure 3 for clarity. In addition to the reverberated signals associated with the hearing aid microphones, the signal close to the eardrum is also generated. You can also access the reverberated speech and noise signals before they are mixed.  Figure 3. Simplified diagram of the scene generator.

This is achieved by scaling the interferer. Pilot tests have been conducted to get this approximately correct. Scaling is done this way because it does not require recomputing the BRIRs. Note that the interferer can be at any azimuth from the point of view of the listener/receiver.  A desired signal-to-noise ratio, SNRD_DD​ (dB), is chosen using a uniform probability distribution random number generator between the limits of ranges specified for the speech and non-speech interferers. The calculation is based on the ear that has the better signal to noise ratio, as this mimics the better ear effect in binaural listening, where listeners focus on the ear that has the best SNR. The better ear SNR (BE_SNR) is calculated for the reference channel (channel 1, which corresponds to the front microphone of the hearing aid). This value is used to scale all interferer channels. The procedure is described below.  For the reference channel,  The segment of the interferer that overlaps with the target (without padding) , i‘, and the target (without padding), t‘, are extractedSpeech-weighted SNRs are calculated for each ear, SNRL_LL​ and SNRR_RR​: Signals i‘ and t’ are separately convolved with a speech-weighting filter, h (specified below).The rms is calculated for each convolved signal.SNRL_LL​ and SNRR_RR​ are calculated as the ratio of these rms values. The BE_SNR is selected as the maximum of the two SNRs: BE_SNR = max(SNRL_LL​ and SNRR_RR​).  Then per channel,  The whole interferer signal, i, is scaled by the BE_SNR i=i×i = i \\timesi=i× BE_SNR Finally, i is scaled as follows: i=i×10−SNRD/20i = i \\times 10^{-SNR_D/20}i=i×10−SNRD​/20  The speech-weighting filter is an FIR designed using the host window method [2, 3].

The listening panel are experienced bilateral hearing-aid users (they use two hearing aids but the hearing loss may be asymmetrical) with an averaged hearing loss as measured by pure tone air-conduction of between 25 and about 60 dB in the better ear, with fluent speaking of (and listening to) British English.  For every listener, you will be given the left and right pure tone air-conduction audiograms. These measure the threshold at which people can hear a pure-tone sound. For some listeners you will be provided with additional characterisation of their hearing. Consequently, if you wish to exploit this additional data, you will need to deal with the missing data. See the FAQ for more on missing data. Below is a description of each measure.  SSQ12 - Speech, Spatial, &amp; Qualities of Hearing questionnaire, 12-question version​  This is a popular self-assessment questionnaire of hearing disability. Each item asks about listening situations typical of real life and asks how well a listener would do in it. The SSQ assesses ability to make successful use of one’s hearing (i.e. hearing disability, or activity limitation). This is an intermediate link between the audiological measurement of someone's hearing loss (i.e. their impairment) and a patient's assessment of how that hearing loss impacts their wider life (i.e. their handicap, or participation restriction). The 12 questions are given in table 1 of this paper and FYI a recent paper that used it is here.  Responses to each question are on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 representing &quot;not at all&quot; (or &quot;jumbled&quot;/&quot;concentrate hard&quot; for #11 &amp; #12), and 10 representing &quot;perfect&quot; (or &quot;not jumbled&quot;/&quot;no need to concentrate&quot;). We programmed this as a visual-analog slider, which the participant could set to any position from 0 to 10. The SSQ12 data supplied are the responses to each question, from 0-10 at 1 decimal place resolution, along with the mean of all 12 questions.  GHAPB - Glasgow hearing-aid benefit profile questionnaire​  This is designed to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of someone's hearing aid(s) in different scenarios. It asks respondents to consider four scenarios involving speech and to rate on a five-point scale their perceived initial (i.e. unaided) hearing disability, initial handicap, aided benefit, aided handicap, hearing aid use, and hearing aid satisfaction. The listening panel are experienced hearing-aid users, so some of the rating would be about their normal hearing aid. This paper describes the GHABP and provides some normative data.  For each scenario, the participant is asked a primary question about if a situation happens to them (relatable). If they answer  No, it moves onto to the next scenario.Yes, then a list of six secondary questions are asked (see figure below) If one of the secondary questions is not relatable to the participant, they're asked to respond &quot;N/A&quot; for not applicable.  Figure 2. The GHAPB questionnaire.  There are four scenarios:  listening to the television when the volume is adjusted for others.Having a conversation with one person in quiet.Having a conversation on a busy street or in a shop.Having a conversation with several people in a group.  In the datafile, the question numbers are coded as x.y where x is the scenario number and y the secondary question number.  If the answer to primary questions is No, then all the secondary questions are coded as 0.  If the answer to primary questions is Yes, then each subsequent question is scored as 0. = N/A  = first option in the list (eg &quot;no difficulty&quot;)= second= third= fourth= fifth (e.g. &quot;cannot manage at all&quot;)  There is no global score for the GHABP. The six secondary questions ask about different things and so should not be averaged across questions, though it is fairly common to average within-question across scenario.  DTT (digit-triplet test, also known as a triple digit test)​  This is an adaptive test of speech-in-noise ability. In each trial a listener hears three spoken digits (e.g. 3-6-1) against a background of noise at a given signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The task is to respond on a keypad with those three digits in the order they were presented. If the listener gets all three correct, then the SNR is reduced for the next trial so making it slightly harder. If the listener makes any mistake (i.e., any digit wrong, or the order wrong) then the SNR is increased, so making the next trial slightly easier. The test carries on trial-by-trial. The test asymptotes to the SNR at which the participant is equally likely to get all three correct or not, with a few tens of trials needed to get an acceptable result. DTT tests are now used world-wide to measure hearing as they are easy to make in any local language, to explain to participants and to do, and moreover can be done over the internet or telephone as they measure a relative threshold (signal-to-noise ratio), not an absolute threshold in dB SPL. Listeners are encouraged to set a volume that is comfortable and that does not distort or crackle, but is not too quiet.  This paper is a recent scoping review of the field. The particular version we used is Vlaming et al's high-frequency DTT, which uses a high-pass noise as the masker. Ours starts at -14 dB SNR, goes up/down at 2 dB steps per trial, and continues for 40 trials.  In the datafile, an average of the SNR for the last 30 trials is provided (labelled 'threshold'). For reference, the SNRs are supplied for each trial as well. The very first trial is practice and is not scored.

Consequently, this signal processing challenge is designed to get the latest advancements in speech enhancement applied to hearing aids.  Entrants are tasked to enhance speech-in-noise for input into a hearing aid amplification stage. The hearing aid will be tuned to the hearing characteristics of particular people. Thus you can enter without in-depth knowledge of hearing aids, and just concentrate on the task of de-noising.  The scenario is listening to speech in the presence of typical domestic noise. We provide the signals captured by the microphones on a pair of behind-the-ear hearing aids and those captured at the eardrum. The target speech will be a short sentence. The interfering noises will be a mix of speech, domestic appliance noise and music. The audio includes the simulation of the acoustic of typical small living rooms.  The challenge is to improve the speech intelligibility without excessive loss of quality. To this end, entries will be evaluated using an objective metric that is an average of the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI).

It can refer to how much speech is understood by a listener, or to the number of words correctly identified by a listener as a proportion or percentage of the total number of words. In the Clarity project, we are using the latter definition, i.e., the percentage of words in a sentence that a listener identified correctly. This percentage is the target for your prediction models.  Speech intelligibility captures how a listener's ability to participate in conversation is changed when the speech signal is degraded, e.g., by background noise and room reverberation, or is processed, e.g., by a hearing aid. Your prediction model will need to incorporate a model of the hearing abilities of each listener.

Objective measures are also useful when measured speech intelligibility scores are unavailable, such as when developing a machine learning-based hearing aid algorithm or some other speech enhancement method. Another advantage of non-intrusive measures is that they do not require time-alignment of processed and reference signals.  Objective measures - or metrics - of speech intelligibility are used to allow a computer to estimate the likely performance of humans in listening tests. The main goal of entries to the prediction challenge is to produce one of these measures that performs well for listeners with hearing loss. There are two broad classes of speech intelligibility models:  Intrusive metrics (also known as double-ended) are most common. This is where the intelligibility is estimated by comparing the degraded or processed speech signal with the original clean speech signal.Non-intrusive metrics (also known as single-ended or blind) are less well developed. This is where intelligibility is estimated from the degraded or processed speech signal alone.  In the Clarity project, both types of metrics are of interest. Intrusive metrics will be more accurate in many cases. However, there are hearing aid processes where the speech content is shifted in frequency, which will defeat most current intrusive speech intelligibility metrics. We also hypothesise that there might be issues with intrusive metrics and machine learning approaches in hearing aids that revoice the original speech.

In this seminar from the first Clarity workshop, James Kates discusses speech intelligibility models with a focus on the ones he has developed. He also discusses the speech quality metric HASQI. If you're interested in using HASPI or HASQI for the challenge, James Kates has kindly made the MATLAB code and user guide available for download.    Click arrow to see synopsis. Signal degradations, such as additive noise and nonlinear distortion, can reduce the intelligibility and quality of a speech signal. Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyse the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.

Click arrow to see synopsis. Hearing loss leads to several unwanted effects. Loss of audibility for soft sounds is one effect, but also when amplification is used to create audibility for soft sounds, many suprathreshold deficits remain. The most common type of hearing loss is a cochlear hearing loss, where haircells or nerve synapses in the cochlea are damaged. Ageing and noise exposure are the most common causes of cochlear hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is associated with atypical loudness perception and difficulties in noisy situations. Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech-in-noise (SPIN) is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed. The balance between being able to have a conversation with a specific communication partner in a group of people and being able to switch attention if someone else starts to talk will be touched upon.

In the Clarity project, we are using the latter definition, i.e., the percentage of words in a sentence that a listener identified correctly. This percentage is the target for your prediction models.  Speech intelligibility captures how a listener's ability to participate in conversation is changed when the speech signal is degraded, e.g., by background noise and room reverberation, or is processed, e.g., by a hearing aid.

Objective measures are also useful when measured speech intelligibility scores are unavailable, such as when developing a machine learning-based hearing aid algorithm or some other speech enhancement method. Another advantage of non-intrusive measures is that they do not require time-alignment of processed and reference signals.  Objective measures - or metrics - of speech intelligibility are used to allow a computer to estimate the likely performance of humans in listening tests. The main goal of entries to the prediction challenge is to produce one of these measures that performs well for listeners with hearing loss. There are two broad classes of speech intelligibility models:  Intrusive metrics (also known as double-ended) are most common. This is where the intelligibility is estimated by comparing the degraded or processed speech signal with the original clean speech signal.Non-intrusive metrics (also known as single-ended or blind) are less well developed. This is where intelligibility is estimated from the degraded or processed speech signal alone.  In the Clarity project, both types of metrics are of interest. Intrusive metrics will be more accurate in many cases. However, there are hearing aid processes where the speech content is shifted in frequency, which will defeat most current intrusive speech intelligibility metrics. We also hypothesise that there might be issues with intrusive metrics and machine learning approaches in hearing aids that revoice the original speech.

In this seminar from the first Clarity workshop, James Kates discusses speech intelligibility models with a focus on the ones he has developed. He also discusses the speech quality metric HASQI. If you're interested in using HASPI or HASQI for the challenge, James Kates has kindly made the MATLAB code and user guide available for download.    Click arrow to see synopsis. Signal degradations, such as additive noise and nonlinear distortion, can reduce the intelligibility and quality of a speech signal. Predicting intelligibility and quality for hearing aids is especially difficult since these devices may contain intentional nonlinear distortion designed to make speech more audible to a hearing-impaired listener. This speech processing often takes the form of time-varying multichannel gain adjustments. Intelligibility and quality metrics used for hearing aids and hearing-impaired listeners must therefore consider the trade-offs between audibility and distortion introduced by hearing-aid speech envelope modifications. This presentation uses the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI) to predict intelligibility and quality, respectively. These indices incorporate a model of the auditory periphery that can be adjusted to reflect hearing loss. They have been trained on intelligibility scores and quality ratings from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners for a wide variety of signal and processing conditions. The basics of the metrics are explained, and the metrics are then used to analyse the effects of additive noise on speech, to evaluate noise suppression algorithms, and to measure differences among commercial hearing aids.

Details Click arrow to see synposis. Hearing loss leads to several unwanted effects. Loss of audibility for soft sounds is one effect, but also when amplification is used to create audibility for soft sounds, many suprathreshold deficits remain. The most common type of hearing loss is a cochlear hearing loss, where haircells or nerve synapses in the cochlea are damaged. Ageing and noise exposure are the most common causes of cochlear hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is associated with atypical loudness perception and difficulties in noisy situations. Background noise masks for instance speech to a higher degree than for a person with healthy hair cells. This explains why listening to speech-in-noise (SPIN) is such an important topic to work on. A brief introduction to signal processing in hearing aids will be presented. With the use of frequency-specific amplification and compression (automatic gain control, AGC), hearing aids are usually doing a good job in compensating for reduced audibility and for atypical suprathreshold loudness perception. However, it is more difficult to compensate for the increased masking effect. Some examples of strategies will be presented. Finally, natural conversations in noise will be discussed. The balance between being able to have a conversation with a specific communication partner in a group of people and being able to switch attention if someone else starts to talk will be touched upon.

The baseline model includes a hearing loss and speech intelligibility model that could be used for creating additional pre-training data.

But for other characterisations of hearing, only some of the panel have provided data. Therefore there is missing data that has to be dealt with.  One approach to the missing data is to just ignore it and just use the audiograms. The problem with this approach is that audiograms only quantifies the hearing threshold, and our speech in noise audio samples were not played that quietly. Nevertheless, audiograms are the most common way of characterising hearing loss. Alternatively, a method to use the partial data could be developed, and we expect this would help with speech intelligibility prediction. You will find plenty of data science blog posts, e.g. towards data science discussing different approaches.  A key question is whether the missing data is 'missing at random' i.e. is the distribution of the missing data expected to be the same as that of the present data? For the prediction challenge, this would mean the missing triple-digit-test values are coming from some random sample of the listeners, who'd be no different from the listeners who did complete the triple-digital-test. Unfortunately, this might not be true, because the failure to complete the triple-digit-tests could well correlate with hearing loss (e.g. maybe older people with more hearing loss were less likely to do the test). The Clarity data is probably 'missing not at random'.  One simple solution is to delete examples with missing data, but the loss of so much data probably makes this undesirable.  A more sophisticated approach is to fill gaps in data via imputation i.e. first estimate values for the missing data and then treat the dataset as complete. A couple of simple approaches for imputation are: (i) use the mean value from the dataset for missing values, and (ii) create a model to estimate the missing data from the audiograms. There are other approaches in data science that could be exploited such as coding the missing values into a 'N/A' category within the input data.

The average pure tone air-conduction hearing loss will be between 25 and about 60 dB in the better ear. They will be fluent in British English.  The quantification of the listeners’ hearing is done with:  Left and right pure tone air-conduction audiograms. These measure the threshold at which people can hear a pure-tone sound.Results from the DTT (digit-triplet test, also known as a triple digit test)​  The audiogram is the standard clinical measurement of hearing ability. It’s the pure-tone threshold of hearing in each ear, measured in quiet in a sound booth. The procedure is standardized e.g., British Society of Audiology Recommended Procedure. Typically it’s measured at octave frequencies and important intermediate frequencies.The values of the audiogram defines how much gain the hearing aid needs to apply, with the calculation typically done by one of a group of &quot;prescription rules&quot;, e.g. CAMFIT, NAL-NL2 or DSL .  Note that the scale of an audiogram is in “dB HL” = “dB Hearing Level”. This is not dB SPL; instead, it’s relative to an international standard such that 0-dB is “normal hearing” at every frequency. For background see Why the Audiogram Is Upside-down | The Hearing Review and The Quest for Audiometric Zero | The Hearing Review  The DTT is an adaptive test of speech-in-noise ability. In each trial a listener hears three spoken digits (e.g. 3-6-1) against a background of noise at a given signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The task is to respond on a keypad with those three digits in the order they were presented. If the listener gets all three correct, then the SNR is reduced for the next trial so making it slightly harder. If the listener makes any mistake (i.e., any digit wrong, or the order wrong) then the SNR is increased, so making the next trial slightly easier. The test carries on trial-by-trial. The test asymptotes to the SNR at which the participant is equally likely to get all three correct or not, with a few tens of trials needed to get an acceptable result. DTT tests are now used world-wide to measure hearing as they are easy to make in any local language, to explain to participants and to do, and moreover can be done over the internet or telephone as they measure a relative threshold (signal-to-noise ratio), not an absolute threshold in dB SPL. Listeners are encouraged to set a volume that is comfortable and that does not distort or crackle, but is not too quiet.  This paper is a recent scoping review of the field. The particular version we used is Vlaming et al.'s high-frequency DTT, which uses a high-pass noise as the masker. Ours starts at -14 dB SNR, goes up/down at 2 dB steps per trial, and continues for 40 trials.  In the datafile, an average of the SNR for the last 30 trials is provided (labelled 'threshold'). For reference, the SNRs are supplied for each trial as well. The very first trial is practice and is not scored.

Multiple scenes can be made by changing the target and masker choices for a given room. E.g., participants wanting to expand the training data could remix multiple scenes from the same room.  The listener ID is not stored in the scene metadata; this information is stored separately in a scenes_listeners.json file which maps scenes to listeners, ie. telling you which listener (or listeners) will be listening to which scenes in the evaluation (see Section D.9).  Noise interferers are labelled with a type “music”, “noise” or “speech” and then have a unique name identifying the file.  For speech: &lt;ACCENT_CODE&gt;_&lt;SPEAKER_ID&gt; where ACCENT_CODE is a three letter code identify the accent region and gender of the speaker and SPEAKER_ID is a 5-digit ID specific to an individual speaker. E.g. &quot;mif_02484&quot; is a UK midlands accented female, speaker 02484. The speech comes from Demirshan et al. [1] which provides more details.For noise: CIN_&lt;NOISE_TYPE&gt;_&lt;NOISE_ID&gt; where NOISE_TYPE is one of dishwasher, fan, hairdryer, kettle, microwave, vacuum (vacuum cleaner) or washing (washing machine) and NOISE_ID is a unique 3-digit code for the sample.For music: track_&lt;TRACK_ID&gt; where TRACK_ID is unique 7-digit track identifier taken from the MTG Jamendo database. [2]  Given the type and name, further interferer metadata can be found in the files masker_speech_list.json, masker_noise_list.json and masker_music_list.json which are distributed with the challenge.
